# Bridge
I'm not letting some random ass retard try and use this old broken version of Bridge against me, so let's open source it.

The code is a mess, I already know, we kept reforking this rank core since Combo back in 2017 where my Java Knowledge was quite shit (you can tell what parts are updated).
We no longer use this version of Bridge and had not used this in a looooooooooooooooooong time  (i believe it was during the hydra/temper ownership)

enjoy skidding broken code, yessirrr.
